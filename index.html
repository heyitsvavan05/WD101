           <center><strong>  I sentenced myself.</center></strong>

I sentenced myself behind bars of chaos.<br>
Where forever does exist.<br>
Forever i locked myself where<br>
Stars refuse to shine.<br>
Where overrated darkness is a good light shining up my face.<br>
Sentenced myself a life where grays' too<br> good to be a glimpse.<br>
A roofless bars i sat myself in the corner;<br>
Sometimes in the middle and drown myself<br>
With emptiness of nostalgic waves <br>
That keeps me hug my knees tight.<br>
I sentenced myself with all these pain<br> yesterday;  before all good things.<br>
It's funny how a sudden plottwist will shut <br>the prism and staled the crimson<br> running down the hill.<br><br>

I felt someone tapped my shoulder.<br>
As her fingers lift from my skin,<br>
I saw a lil bit of glitter.<br>
Twas a bit blinding but mesmerizing.<br>
I blinked five times and everything turned up.<br><br>

I was fighting a weoponless war<br>
Inside this roofless place.<br>
Barely breathing all this time.<br>
But as you walked in,<br>
Your footprints has revived a withered tree-<br>-which i thought of a perfect gallows.
<br><br>
Where I've been before, I've seen all these <br>oblivion come crashing through my head.<br>
But you came and cupped my face and<br> slight turned to the view you are walking.<br><br>

You brought me all the rainbows and<br> butterflies.<br>
Or i should say, you brought me the<br> paradise and put the zoo in my tummy.<br><br>

Now i sentence myself forever by your side.

<center><strong>Loosing to Resilience<br>
<sub><i>01052017</sub></i>

</center></strong>
<br><br>

There's always this thought dwelling<br> inside<br> my head that I couldn't unroom.<br>

That everytime a lay here with all by myself.<br>

My vulnerability rises that I couldn't help but to overthink. <br>

To the point my body gets numb<br>

When everything that scribbles inside my head are thoughts of<br>

Loosing the grip to resilience—<br>

One by one fingers letting go.<br><br>



In a tree of stars one by one falling.<br>

In a graveyard of stars with their lights off.<br>

where in a universe of beautiful misty eyes<br>

you'll see them scream<br>

Hopelessly screaming their pain out.<br><br>



all hearts tend to be fallen into pieces<br>

burying all it's dead piece<br>

burning and locking all them down<br>

within a piece of paper.<br><br>



see them wordly scream.<br>

feel it's thought stabbing your chest.<br><br>



the thought of loosing you keeps on haunting me.<br>

the thought of living back to where i used to keeps on pulling me.<br>

the thoughts that slitting my throat slowly. <br>

hearing it slash— hearing it's music that was once a beautiful melody to my ears.<br>

<br>

i die with enigmatic thoughts i hear inside my head.<br>

it has always been living inside my head being taunted with these thoughts.

<br><br>

that whenever i try to lit up the darkest part of my head the<br> more room it rooms to darken.<br>
